Analyzing Cryptocurrency Markets Using Machine Learning Techniques
This collection of code looks at different machine learning models to study cryptocurrency markets. It tackles jobs like guessing coin prices, putting coins with similar patterns into groups, and checking how people feel about crypto on social media.
Project Overview
This project uses historical data from leading cryptocurrencies to train and test models.
The code is in Python (using libraries like pandas and scikit-learn) in Jupyter Notebook.
It uses supervised learning models (such as Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines) to predict Bitcoin prices.
It applies unsupervised learning methods (like K-Means clustering) to spot patterns or gain insights from the trading data.

## Implementation
We have completed:
- Predicting Bitcoin Price with Supervised Learning Methods (https://github.com/MyslfFalcon/Crypto-Market-Analysis/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning)
- Cryptocurrency Market Analysis with Unsupervised Learning Methods (https://github.com/MyslfFalcon/Crypto-Market-Analysis/tree/main/Unsupervised%20Learning)

## We plan to do:
- Cryptocurrency Market Analysis with Deep Learning Methods

## Future Work
We aim to:
- Look into deep learning structures (like LSTMs) for time series forecasting
- Compare how different models perform
- Add more features that might affect price (such as social sentiment)

## Disclaimer
Analyzing the cryptocurrency market is tricky, and we created these models just to learn. Don't take this analysis as financial advice.
